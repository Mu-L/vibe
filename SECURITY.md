# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Issues

If you find a security issue in Vibe, please report it responsibly.  
I take security reports seriously and will do my best to review and address valid issues.

The preferred way to report a vulnerability is via GitHub’s **Security Advisory – “Report a Vulnerability”** feature.

- Please do NOT open a public GitHub issue for security-related reports.
- Include as much detail as possible so I can understand and reproduce the issue.

If you can’t use GitHub Security Advisories, you can also reach out to me directly via **Vibe’s Discord channel** (linked on the Vibe website) and send me a DM.  
Please use this channel only for security-related matters.

After the initial report, I’ll reply with next steps and may ask for more details if needed.

## Supported Versions

Security fixes are provided only for the latest released version of Vibe.

## Third-Party Dependencies

If the issue is in a third-party dependency, it’s usually best to report it directly to the maintainers of that project as well.

Thanks for helping keep Vibe secure.
