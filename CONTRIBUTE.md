# Contributing to Vibe

Thanks for thinking about contributing! 🎉

## What We Focus On

This repo contains the core Vibe transcription app and examples.  
Our goals: improve the app, add useful examples, fix bugs, and keep the codebase minimal and clean.  
We avoid unnecessary complexity and try to keep things straightforward.

Before contributing, **please open a [new issue](https://github.com/thewh1teagle/vibe/issues)** to discuss your idea **before** starting any work.  
This keeps contributions aligned with the project and avoids wasted effort.

✅ **Exception:**  
If you're fixing a clear **critical bug**, you may open a PR without prior discussion. **but the PR must contain _only_ the relevant fix (no refactors, formatting, etc.)** and the description should mention the bug and link an issue if possible.

## Pull Request Guidelines

- **Do not open a PR from your `main` branch** — use a feature/fix branch.
- **Test your changes locally before opening the PR** so reviews and merging stay smooth.
- If you're fixing a **critical bug**, you may skip issue discussion — but the PR must contain **only the relevant fix** (no refactors, no formatting changes).
- If your change affects core logic or behavior, include a short explanation or example in the PR description.

## AI-Assisted (Vibe Coding) PRs

We welcome PRs written with AI tools! Just hold them to the same standard as any other PR:

- **Stay focused** — one clear change per PR, no drive-by refactors or formatting noise.
- **Know the codebase** — have the agent read our docs and follow existing conventions before writing code.
- **Review what it wrote** — you're responsible for the final result, not the AI.
- **Large or wide-reaching changes?** Open an issue first so we can align before you invest time.
- **High bar, same as everyone** — AI-generated code must be clean, tested, and minimal.
